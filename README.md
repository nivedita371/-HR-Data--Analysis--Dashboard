## Process:
-Data Collection & Preparation: Gather HR data from various sources (e.g., employee records, payroll, performance reviews) and clean it using Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.

-Data Import into Power BI: Load the cleaned data into Power BI, establishing relationships between tables to create a cohesive dataset.

-Dashboard Development: Design interactive visualizations in Power BI, utilizing features like slicers and filters to allow dynamic exploration of HR metrics.

-Review & Deployment: Thoroughly test the dashboard for accuracy, make necessary adjustments, and publish it to the Power BI Service for access by stakeholders.
## Project Insights:

1. The dashboard reveals which departments have the highest turnover, helping HR prioritize retention interventions.
2. Patterns in average tenure show which roles or levels are more stable vs. those with frequent exits.
3. Demographic breakdowns (age, gender, etc.) provide visibility into diversity and identify potential inclusion gaps.
4. Attendance and absenteeism trends expose problematic time periods, enabling proactive policies around wellness and scheduling.
  ## Final Conclusion:
  
This HR Analytics Dashboard transforms raw HR and employee data into actionable insights, enabling HR leaders to identify retention risks, optimize hiring strategies, and drive dataâ€‘backed decisions. With clear visualizations and key metrics, it strengthens organizational capability to improve workforce stability, performance, and employee satisfaction.
